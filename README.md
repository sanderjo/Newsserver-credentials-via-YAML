Newsserver credentials via YAML ... some experiments

My experience: I have a few newsserver accounts, which I all use acros different systems. 
If there was a standard format for newsservers credentials, used by newsserver provider and newsserver / NZB client, it would be easy to configure things.

So ... what could that standard format be. Here are some YAML files to experiment with that.

Oh, why YAML? Because are both human and machine readable. So a newsserver provider can just put the YAML info into a mail.
Which you cannot say of XML of JSON.
